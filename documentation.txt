To begin, my project is a text-based Blackjack game with an option to play against a computer user as well. It is important for my
project to function correctly that all of the necessary files (card.py, computer_player.py, dealer.py, deck.py, driver.py, hand.py,
human_player.py, and player.py are all in the same folder, or else the program will not work. If they are all in the same folder,
you can continue to the next step.

To use my project, first save all of the files as you would any other python program. Then, in the terminal of where you are running
the project (I just ran mine in the CS50 terminal), type the following: "python driver.py". This will run the main method of my 
program and make the program begin running.

Next, the program will repeatedly prompt you for different kinds of inputs. When prompted, please type in the type (number, name,
etc.) of whatever the program asks you to type in, and then press return or enter. Note: I did not do error checking on types of 
inputs, so if you try to enter a bunch of random characters or letters when prompted for a number, it will most likely crash the
program. If this happens, just run the program again using "python driver.py". The game will proceed as a regular blackjack game
might, as the screen prompts the user to hit, stand, surrender, or double down, as a blackjack game might (do not have split
implemented). At the end of the round, the screen will prompt if you would like to play another round (player balances will carry 
over, unless a user has zero balance, in which they case they are removed from the game). It is a fairly straight-forward program.
