1. 

function validate(phone)
{
    var length = phone.length;
    // Check both if the length is 10 and if the variable is NotANumber (isNan)
    if (length == 10 && !isNan(phone))
    {
        // if it satisfies both of these conditions, return true
        return true;
    }
    // otherwise, return false
    return false;
}

function validate(phone)
{
    // get rid of any '-', ' ', '(', and ')' characters to make the formatting nice!

    phone.replace(/-/g, "").replace(/ /g, "").replace(/\(|\)/g);
    
    var length = phone.length;
    // Check both if the length is 10 and if the variable is NotANumber (isNan)
    if (length == 10 && !isNan(phone))

3. Critique this implementation of profile, identifying its faults.
    Answer: This implementation of profile isn't great because of the way SQL works. We saw in our previous two psets, and
    especially in pset7, that SQL is inherently at risk of injection attack. To prevent this, we use named bind parameters so that
    we prevent against this injection. In addition, it is poor form to use .format because this can also lead to an SQL injection
    attack. Basically, if you want your code to get injected, go ahead and use this implementation (please don't).
